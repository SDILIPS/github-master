Run time analysis (Worst-Case Big-O Notation) for the following tasks:

- Task 0:
    Since the first element and last element is just accessed and printed, and len() takes O(1), the worst case time complexity is O(1)

- Task 1:
    Since the two input lists are iterated one after the other, the worst case time complexity is O(n) + O(n), which can be approximated to O(n)

- Task 2:
    Since we are iterating the 'calls' list once, the worst case time complexity is O(n)

- Task 3:
    Since we are iterating the 'calls' list once, inserting to a set once, the worst case time complexity is O(n). However, the sort takes O(n logn) time complexity. Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n logn).

- Task 4:
    Since we are iterating the 'calls' list once, inserting to a set once, the worst case time complexity is O(n). However, the sort takes O(n logn) time complexity. Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n logn).
